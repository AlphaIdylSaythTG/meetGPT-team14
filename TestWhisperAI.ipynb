            "[00:14.000 --> 00:25.000]  Sure things Andrew as if now we're on track with the development phase, she shank and I have been working closely on the coding and we've made significant progress on the core functionalities.\n",
            "[00:25.000 --> 00:35.000]  That's correct we managed to implement major components and the initial testing looks promising, however, there are a few minor bugs that need to be addressed before moving forward.\n",
            "[00:35.000 --> 00:37.000]  Great work so far.\n",
            "[00:37.000 --> 00:43.000]  Pronathy, how are things on the design and user interface side.\n",
            "[00:44.000 --> 00:54.000]  The design is shaping up nicely, I've created wire frames for the main screens and after some feedback sessions with the team we fell on the clean and intuitive UI.\n",

            "[01:20.000 --> 01:32.000]  Agree it's just shank let's schedule a separate meeting to discuss performance improvements in more detail now regarding the timeline of cool are we still on track to meet the deadline.\n",
            "[01:32.000 --> 01:41.000]  Yes, as a matter we are, but we need to be cautious about the bug fixes and potential challenges ahead.\n",
            "[01:41.000 --> 01:49.000]  I think we should allocate some time for user testing and gather feedback to ensure we deliver a polished product.\n",
